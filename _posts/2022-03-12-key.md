atlassian 계정과 비밀번호를 변경했는데도 로그인이 안될 경우,
인텔리J 에서 App password 로 로그인하는 법 


1. Login to Bitbucket
2. Click on your profile image on the right (now on the bottom left)
3. Choose Bitbucket settings (now Personal settings)
4. Under Access management section look for the App passwords option (https://bitbucket.org/account/settings/app-passwords/)
5. Create an app password with permissions at least to Read under Repositories section. A password will be generated for you. Remember to save it, it will be shown only once!
6. The username will be your Google username BitBucket username.
